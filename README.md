What are design patterns?
According to wiki(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern), 

1. In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
2. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code.
3. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
4. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
5. Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved.
6. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.
7. Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.


1. Singleton Design pattern - Singleton falls under creational design patterns category, which ensures a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

2. Facade Design pattern - Facade falls under structural design patterns category, which provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code. It can be used when 
	1. a simple interface is required to access a complex system.
	2. a system is verly complex or difficult to understand.
	3. an entry point is needed to each layer of a layered software.
